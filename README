This is the new place for my MVC framework assignment

INSTALL:
cp application/config/config.sample.php application/config/config.php

more to come (about cms+db)

WARNINGS:
Don't forget to change RewriteBase in .htaccess if you don't want to spend some time messing around trying to fix apache whining about infinite recursions....
